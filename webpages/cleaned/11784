Ardalan Amiri Sani Ardalan Amiri Sani Assistant Professor Computer Science Department University of California, Irvine Email: ardalan at uci dot edu Office: Donald Bren Hall #3206 Home Students Publications Courses Services Downloads I joined the CS department at UC Irvine in July 2015. I received my M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the ECE department at Rice University, and my B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology. I direct the Trustworthy Systems Lab (TrussLab). Our lab's research involves building trustworthy systems. Our projects are often at the intersection of mobile computing, security, and operating systems. Prospective Students I'm always looking for motivated graduate and undergraduate students who enjoy building systems to join our lab. If you're interested, send me an email or drop by my office.
