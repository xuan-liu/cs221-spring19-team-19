David Eppstein - Publications David Eppstein - Publications New algorithms for minimum area k-gons. D. Eppstein. Tech. Rep. 91-59, ICS, UCI, 1991. 3rd ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, Orlando, 1992, pp. 83–86. Shows that the minimum area polygon containing k of n points must be near a line determined by two points, and uses this observation to find the polygon quickly. Merged with "Iterated nearest neighbors and finding minimal polytopes" in the journal version. (BibTeX – Citations) Publications – David Eppstein – Theory Group – Inf. & Comp.
