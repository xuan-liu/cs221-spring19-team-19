On the NP-completeness of cryptarithms. D. Eppstein. SIGACT News 18 (3): 38–40, 1987. A cryptarithm (also known as an alphametic) is a puzzle in which the digits of a mathematical formula (typically addition of two large numbers) are replaced by letters; the goal is to determine which letter stands for which digits. If arithmetic is done in a polynomially large radix, the problem becomes NP-complete. (BibTeX – Full paper – Citations) Years – Publications – David Eppstein – Theory Group – Inf. & Comp.
