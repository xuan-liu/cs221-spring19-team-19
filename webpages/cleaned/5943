An example of how to use the module is available in src/sepia/example.cc. Interface The main class of the module is Sepia which is declared in src/sepia/sepia.h. The main methods of Sepia are:   Sepia(const vector<string> &dataset, 
        unsigned thresholdMin,
        unsigned thresholdMax);
  Sepia(const vector<string> &dataset,
        const string &filename);

  void build();
  void saveData(const string &filename) const;
  
  float getEstimateSelectivity(const string &query, unsigned editdist) const;
 The main idea is that the user can create a Sepia object by specifying a vector of strings (dataset) and a few extra parameters (for details see [1]) or load an existing one from a file. If the object was not loaded, then it needs to be built. Next, the user has the option of saving the object to a file. In order to estimate the selectivity of a given string, the user calls select. Performance The performance results are available in [1] and [2]. Contributors Rares Vernica [1] Liang Jin and Chen Li: Selectivity Estimation for Fuzzy String Predicates in Large Data Sets.
