This calligraphy appears in Inversions, a book by Scott Kim, who learned to write in this style. Students accepted to CMU would wear this badge when visiting the campus; I sometimes wore it too, because I admit I'm still a student, learning new things. I have put my collection of Quotations for Learning and Programing on the web. I hope to continue expanding (and correcting) it. I always welcome feedback (e.g., corrections, misattributions, other quotations). I am starting to index, annotate, and put on the web various Education-Related Video Clips. Spring 2019 Teaching Schedule Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) 7: Introducing Modern Computational Tools Lecture A Final Exam: TBA (but given as an In-Lab Exam) (closed book/closed notes/) Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) 33: Intermediate Programming Lecture A Final Exam: Wednesday, June 12th from 10:30am - 12:30pm (closed book/closed notes/closed computer/closed calculator) Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) 193: Tutoring in ICS No Final Exam I'll be in class (lecture/yellow) and/or will hold office hours (gray) all days, except Thursday. Please note that my office hours are open. There is no need to schedule an appointment ahead of time. Just drop by. If you want debugging help, please explore the problem before coming in, and be ready to report on how you tried to solve it. And, if we need to meet privately, I can close my door.

I will send email those days if I cannot attend office hours. Interesting Snippets While developing a manuscript for a textbook on the Ada programming language in the late 1980s, I wrote a chapter on EBNF and began teaching it on the "first" day of my CS-1 class: primarily as a microcosm of programming, but also as a practical tool for later describing the syntax of Ada. These 21 pages (less than 1/4 the size of the original Karel book) discuss the sequence, choice, option, repetition, and recursion control structures (along with "procedural" abstracton via named EBNF rules). They explore various methods of proving that tokens satisfy descriptions, that descriptions are equivalent (and how to simplify them), and the difference between syntax and semantics. I have continued to use this approach until this day in my CS-1 classes. In fact, I have rewritten this EBNF chapter for an introduction to Python course I am teaching. An excerpt from the chapter "He Fixes Radios by Thinking!" from the book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!": Adventures of a Curious Character (start at the bottom of page 18: "One day I got a telephone call..." and finish at the bottom of page 20: "...never thought that was possible.") Explains why debugging is best accomplished by thinking, not fiddling. A short opinion piece on Plagiarism from the NY Times. A short opinion piece on What Straight-A Students Get Wrong from the NY Times. I too have run across many students whose goal is to graduate with a 4.0 (more at CMU than UCI). I hope they fall short of that mark early in their studies, so they can be freed to pursue getting an education, both inside and outside the classroom. At every school that I have, taught, I have recommend , but so far been ignored, that all entering students receive 1 unit of credit for a course called "Getting an Education Sanely". Every student would uniformly be assigned a grade of A-; then, pursuit of a 4.0 becomes an asymptotic fantasy. Genius is a Thing that Happens from Jordan Ellenberg's How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking. Why Mathematics (and Computer Science) students should not be discouraged by smarter classmates. A new cure for Short Bowel Syndrome (Brainstorm to Breakthrough: A Surgical Procedure is Born). Cartoons: If Charles Schultz wrote Karel the Robot Arlo and Janis: The hardest teacher Doonesbury: Walden's Last B My Favorite Graph: I show this graph (and its associated article) in my data structures class after discussing general graph theory terminology (up to connected components). It is scary and compelling at the same time.

My 2006 SIGCSE Talk Philosphical Musings Doubts are such tiny things. A mind with no room for doubts must have no room for thoughts either. -R. Pattis The following dialog is from the transcript of "Between Time and Timbuktu" (a synthesis of the writings of Kurt Vonnegut). For more on Bokononism, from which this passage is inspired, see The Books of Bokonon (from the novel "Cat's Cradle"). Narrator: In the beginning, G-d created the Earth, and he said, "Let there be mud." And there was mud. And G-d said, "Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done." And G-d created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud-as-man alone could speak. "What is the purpose of all this?" man asked politely. "Everything must have a purpose?" asked G-d. "Certainly," said man. "Then I leave it up to you to think of one for all of this," said G-d. And he went away. Stony Stevenson: I feel very unimportant compared to you [G-d]. Voice of Bokonon: The only way you can feel the least bit important is to think of all the mud that didn't even get to sit up and look around. Stony Stevenson: I got so much, and most mud got so little.
