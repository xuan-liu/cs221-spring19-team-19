    charless c. fowlkes professor computer science uc irvine fowlkes@ics.uci.edu 4076 dbh 949.824.6945 uci : cs : vision group home publications presentations software cv My research is in computational vision, in particular how to integrate mechanisms for visual recognition and perceptual organization with 3D scene understanding. We apply these computational models to a variety of problems including development of tools for biological image and shape analysis in neuroscience, animal development and palynology as well as applications to forensic science. recent research highlights: S.
