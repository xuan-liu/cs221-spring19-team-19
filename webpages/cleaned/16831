 Ian G. Harris Professor, Department of Computer Science University of California Irvine Home Publications Courses Projects Contact Short Bio Ian G. Harris is Professor of Computer Science at the University of California Irvine. He received his BS degree in Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1990. He received his MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University of California San Diego in 1992 and 1997 respectively. He was a member of the faculty in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1997 until June 2003. Research Areas Functional Verification Electronic Design Automation from Natural Language Embedded Systems Security Social Engineering Attack Detection Research projects in Professor Harris' group is related to testing of hardware and software systems. His field of interest includes validation of hardware systems to ensure that the behavior of the system matches the intentions of the designer. He also investigates the application of testing for computer security. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a prominent theme in Professor Harris' work in both security and verification. NLP techniques are used to extract information from hardware specifications, and NLP techniques are used to identify social engineering attacks in a dialog between two speakers. Service Professor Harris serves on the program committees of several leading conferences in hardware design verification and security including IEEE/ACM Design Automation Conference, IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, and IEEE Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST).
